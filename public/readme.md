# CalibreShare

Your friends input their kindle email and they get to choose from your calibre ebooks which one
they want on their kindle email.

[Demo](http://ebooks.grillermo.com/)

### Technical overview

You upload(or sync) your calibre library folder to a public hosting like S3 or an FTP. 
The app stores a copy of your metadata.db locally and using the calibre-ruby gem extracts the books metadata, asumes the book covers are also stored publicly to display them.
Uses Mailgun to take the chosen file and send it to the user email.

### Deploy your own copy

#### Requisites
- Ruby 2.7.2
- Mailgun account, a free one will do.
- A hosting, you can use digital ocean, but not heroku(they disallow the SQLite gem)
- Your calibre library on a publicly accessible hosting.

#### Installation

1. Clone this project.
2. bundle
2. Add .env or set the .env.example variables on your terminal
3. A capfile is provide to deploy using capistrano but you need to customize the `repo_url`â€¨cap production deploy

#### Contribute

You can contribute with anything you want making a pull request but specially needed are:

* Translations
